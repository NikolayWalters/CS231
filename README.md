# CS231

Welcome to the CS231 repository! This repository houses my notes from the online course "CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition" offered by Stanford University. The course provides comprehensive coverage of various topics related to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and their application in visual recognition tasks.

## Course Details

The CS231n course is available online and can be accessed at [CS231n course website](https://cs231n.github.io/). It covers the following key topics:

- Image classification
- Neural networks and deep learning
- Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
- Training neural networks
- CNN interpretation
- Transfer learning
